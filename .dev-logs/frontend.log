23:37:15 [ERROR] [GetStaticPathsRequired] `getStaticPaths()` function is required for dynamic routes. Make sure that you `export` a `getStaticPaths` function from your dynamic route.
  Hint:
    See https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes for more information on dynamic routes.
    
    Alternatively, set `output: "server"` or `output: "hybrid"` in your Astro config file to switch to a non-static server build. This error can also occur if using `export const prerender = true;`.
    See https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/ for more information on non-static rendering.
